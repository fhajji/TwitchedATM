# TwitchedATM

A Stardew Valley SMAPI ATM (bank account) mod with Twitch integration.

## What is this?

* This mod adds an ATM to Stardew Valley simulating a Player's bank account.
* Player can deposit and withdraw any amount of G-money not exceeding what he/she owns in game to or from the ATM.
* The ATM adds season-dependent interest rates for deposited G-money.
* It is possible to have a negative balance up to a configurable amount, for which interest has to be paid.
* When Twitch integration is enabled and configured, the ATM listens to Twitch chat and convert viewers' cheers (bits) into additional G-money and deposits it into Player's account.

## Building instructions

_TODO_

In the meat time, refer to the Stardew Valley Wiki's [IDE Reference](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:IDE_reference)

## Dependencies

* Frameworks:
  - NET 5.0 Runtime (yes, it is EOLed)
* Packages:
  - Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig (4.0.2)
  - TwitchLib (3.5.3)

## Current status

_Nothing implemented yet_

* Initial Boilerplate Code from [Get Started](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/Get_Started): done.

## Credits

The basic idea for the ATM is from [Platonymous ATM mod](https://github.com/Platonymous/Stardew-Valley-Mods/tree/master/ATM)

Variations and Twitch integration are mine.
